**Data structure introduction**

In this tutorial you will learn to use the following three data structures:

- [Stacks](1-stacks.md)
- [Linked lists](2-linked_lists.md)
- [Trees](3-trees.md)

You will find a description with examples and one do-on-your-own exercise.

**Algorithm performance and Big O notation**

Along with the description, examples, and exercises, you will also find a description of the code's performance in Big O notation.
Big O notation will be the way to represent how fast the algorithm will execute. If it could perform an action at once it will have the best performance, or O(1), if the performance is directly proportional to the number of items in the data structure it will have an O(n) performance, in other words it will have to go through several items before it finds the one requested, two more performances are polynomial O(n^2) and logarithmic O(log n) ,  Happy learning.
