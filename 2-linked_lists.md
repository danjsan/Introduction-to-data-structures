# Linked lists

A linked list has the attribute of not following an exact order, in other words, it doesn't necessarily have to store data one value "stacked" next to the other.

The way this list can acces or find the next value is through nodes, sets of a value and a reference to the next node.

Similar to some puzzle pieces, the bigger parto of the piece will store the value and the smaller part will be the link to the next piece.
